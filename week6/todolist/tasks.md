1. store the to-dos locally, so you do not have to start over after refreshing the page
2. use "for of" instead of "for" loop
3. use array methods "sort" and "map" to populate the stored list
4. use array method "reduce" to return the number of to do entries (done and not done)
5. use array method "filter" to remove done to dos automatically from your list
